                        <q>One thing that I admire about Reddit’s culture is that there are so many opportunities to grow — whether it&#039;s yourself, your team, or the product. There is a huge range of personal and professional development resources from giving people the career and mental health tools they need to better themselves to Snoosweek projects where you can work with fellow Snoos on a passion project!</q>

                        <q>I appreciate that Reddit carves out time throughout the year that allows me to reflect on my work and have dedicated conversations with my manager about my wins, areas of improvement, and support I need. Beyond that, I’ve taken advantage of our benefits offerings to attend industry conferences where I’ve been able to collaborate and learn from peers to uplevel my skills. Internally led development programs, leadership trainings, and mentorship opportunities have also made me feel supported in my career growth from all aspects.</q>
